== FeatureHub Opentelemetry Usage Plugin for Java

The purpose of this usage plugin is to allow Usage tracking events to be attached as Span events in OpenTelemetry. 

This allows you to view spans in your OpenTelemetry system and see what features were evaluated, and what their values were. 

If you record a custom FeatureHub Usage event, it will be translated as long as it implements the `UsageEventName` interface. All attributes are logged with a prefix, which defaults to `featurehub.` - but this can be changed on construction.

The plugin does not specify a version of the OpenTelemetry libraries to use,
it expects your application will include and configure all of these.

A simple configuration, it can be used as:

[source,java]
----
config.registerUsagePlugin(new OpenTelemetryUsagePlugin());
----

It is safe to include even if OpenTelemetry is not enabled on your system because it will check it has a valid setup before attempting to log to your OpenTelemetry system.
