= CHANGELOG (jersey3)

- 1.4 - addition of JerseySSEClient which uses the standard Edge retryer code introduced in the 
OkHTTP SSE version, which gives greater control over backoff and server  control. JerseyClient
is deprecated and the JerseySSEClient is now preferred. If you haven't directly constructed it,
it will automatically change under the covers using the Java services mechanism. Adds functionality for upcoming expired environments
- 1.3 - last version using the JerseyClient as the preferred client.
